    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Brick Breaker</h3>
    <p>
	For my first programming project to conclude Coding Bootcamp 2021, I have made a brick breaker game. 
	I used three classes to create interactive objects in the game.

	The paddle class contains code that draws and controls the paddle with 
	the keys "A" to move left and "D" to move right.

	The ball class holds the properties for speed and direction that
	the moves the ball. This also contains the conditions for the 
	ball to bounce off the sides of the window.

	The brick class contains the variables I used to draw the bricks used in the game.

	In the main code I used the classes to draw my objects onto the screen while using
	methods and if statements to create collision detection between the screen sides, 
	moving ball and paddle.

	I also used a nested for loop and an array to create a few rows of bricks however, my collision
	detection was very buggy so I decided to remove it for the showcase so, the other functions of the program work properly but my attempt is included in the code attached
	on GitHub. There is also a game over feature so that if the ball touches the bottom of the screen
	(getting past the paddle) then the program will be paused and a "Game Over" text will
	be displayed. 
	Before bootcamp, most of my knowledge came from my Computer Science A-Levels. 
	I have basic knowledge of coding from when I taught myself some Python to aid in
	completing my A-Level Coursework.
